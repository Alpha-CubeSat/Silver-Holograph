        <h1>Our Outreach</h1>
        <div class="outreach-intro">
          <p>When the Sailing to the Stars mission was initially proposed, advancing aerospace research wasn't the
            team's
            only goal. Outreach has been a significant part of the mission since the beginning. The initial STEM
            engagement and outreach goals were to provide hands-on experience with spacecraft engineering to students
            interested in pursuing careers in STEM fields, conduct outreach programs and workshops, and engage the
            public
            with social media, talks, and events. Since inception, the team can say with confidence that they have made
            great progress in fulfilling these goals. Our students have attended four events already, with more in the
            works.

      <h2>Expanding Your Horizons</h2>
      <p>In March 2025, the team attended Expanding Your Horizons again, this time hosting a workshop for the high
        school-aged students. They set up an activity in which students built their own light-sails, optimized designs
        within constraints, and even worked with a set budget. About 300 students attended the conference!</p>

      <h2>Girl in Science and Engineering, 2025</h2>
      <p>At Girls in Science and Engineering Day, also held at the Intrepid Museum, the team shared the mission's
        research on light-sail deployment methods with future generations of aerospace engineers. Attendees were able to
        participate in our light-sail themed activities, giving them a glimpse of life as a space pioneer. They had over
        200 visitors at our table.

      <h2>Collaboration with Intrepid Musuem</h2>
      <p>This year, our students hosted tables at two Intrepid Museum events in New York City: Kids Week and Girls in
        Science and Engineering Day. Intrepid invites select partners to host tables at the Intrepid museum every year
        for Kids Week, and this year the team was honored to be invited. Our students had one of the most successful
        tables, engaging over 1700 visitors with hands-on activities in which we taught them about light sails. See
        their interview with NASA Spaceflight here: <a
