        <p>The team hit their first major milestone: presenting an update on the deployer design, electrical system
          layout and software overview, and the state of the reaction wheel. They received valuable feedback from
          reviewers that allowed them to solidify their plan and move forward with the project.</p>

        <h2>November 2023 - The Beginning</h2>
        <p>The Sailing to the Stars project officially began in November 2023, inspired by Alpha CubeSat, a sister
          project within the Space Systems Design Studio research lab. The team wanted to better understand exactly how
          the light sail architecture that was first used for that mission works. There are questions they had that
          couldn't be answered with Alpha alone, questions that were crucial in further figuring out how best to deploy
          and use these light sails effectively. The primary goal was to better understand the dynamics of the sail
          deployment - how would the sail and the deployer CubeSat separate? Would the sail be floppy or rigid? Would it
          spin stably or tumble? Would the deployer itself tumble after sail ejection? The mission objectives for Alpha
          did not encompass these questions, paving the way for a new microgravity experiment. So came Sailing to the
          Stars, a project intended to take light sail technology one step closer to solar system exploration and
          beyond.</p>
